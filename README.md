## 🔍 What is Roblox Dead Rails?

**Roblox Dead Rails** is one of the top horror-themed survival games on the platform. Players find themselves trapped aboard a haunted train, where eerie sounds, sudden ghost attacks, and creepy mysteries unfold as the train moves through dark tunnels and forests.

The game's goal? Survive. Solve puzzles. Escape. But survival isn't easy — especially when enemies are unpredictable and your tools are limited.

This is where a **Roblox Dead Rails Script** becomes your best ally.

## 🧠 What Is a Dead Rails Script in Roblox?

A **Dead Rails script** is a custom Lua code that modifies the game to give players unfair advantages. These scripts are executed through third-party Roblox exploit tools or script executors. Once injected into the game, they unlock cheat functions that are normally not available to standard players.

These scripts are often hosted on platforms like **Pastebin**, **GitHub**, or private exploit communities. They’re safe to use (if sourced from trusted sites) and are widely popular among the Roblox scripting community.
